1. Use the existing files
2. Make sure that if file don't exists, you will create new file/directory in the right directory
3. Rest service should be build in the way where the requesting user is the operator. For example I am user, and I want to create a team. System taking from auth my , and taking user info needed from the user service. Another example I am user, and I want to send request to join the team. System should automatically take my User ID from the system and use it in the logic.
example code : 
```java
Authentication auth = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
        if (auth == null || !auth.isAuthenticated()) {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED).build();
        }
        String login = auth.getName();
        UserDTO user = userServiceClient.getByLogin(login);

 ```
